# Bank Management System - Java AWT & Swing with JDBC and MySQL

## Project Description

This project is a **Bank Management System** built using **Java** with **AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)** and **Swing** for creating a desktop graphical user interface (GUI). It uses **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** to connect to a **MySQL** database to manage and store bank account information. The system supports various banking operations such as account creation, balance check, deposit, withdrawal, and account deletion.

  - **Balance Inquiry**
  - **Account Deletion**
- **Data Validation**: Ensures that user inputs are validated before processing.
- **Transaction History**: Tracks deposits and withdrawals for each account.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The programming language used for the application logic and GUI.
- **AWT & Swing**: For creating the graphical user interface.
